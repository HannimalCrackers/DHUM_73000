# Adventures in parseltongue

Hmmm, markdown is interacting with my copy/paste Python from Terminal

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## Mathing with pet names

&nbsp; &nbsp;

>>> Earnest = 10000
>>> print(Earnest)
#### 10000

&nbsp;

>>> Earnest = 5 < 8
>>> print (Earnest)
#### True

&nbsp;

>>> print("Duvel" + "Bear")
#### DuvelBear

>>> print ("Duvel " + "Bear")
#### Duvel Bear

&nbsp;

>>> ExtraKitty = 100
>>> print (ExtraKitty > 6)
#### True

&nbsp;

>>> print ("Duvel " * 3)
#### Duvel Duvel Duvel 

&nbsp;

>>> ss = "Extra Kitty"
>>> print(ss.upper())
#### EXTRA KITTY

 &nbsp;
 
>>> Earnest = "I'm going to eat too fast and puke and then eat that"
>>> print (len(Earnest))
#### 52

&nbsp;

>>> Duvel = "Little orange sunshine"
>>> " ".join(Duvel)
#### 'L i t t l e   o r a n g e   s u n s h i n e'

&nbsp;

>>> print("".join(reversed(Duvel)))
#### enihsnus egnaro elttiL

## Something going wrong here with the line breaks
&nbsp;

>>> '''
... As the wise Ralph said
... My cats breath smells like cat food
... This was a haiku
... '''
#### '\nAs the wise Ralph said\nMy cats breath smells like cat food\nThis was a haiku\n'

&nbsp;

>>> """
... As the wise Ralph said 
... My cat's breath smells like cat food 
... This was a haiku
... """
#### "\nAs the wise Ralph said \nMy cat's breath smells like cat food \nThis was a haiku\n"
>>> 

&nbsp;

I don't understand **line breaks and escape characters**. Research later.
