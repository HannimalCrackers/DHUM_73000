# Adventures in parseltongue

Hmmm, markdown is interacting with my copy/paste Python from Terminal

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## Mathing with pet names

&nbsp; &nbsp;

>>> Earnest = 10000
>>> print(Earnest)
#### 10000

&nbsp;

>>> Earnest = 5 < 8
>>> print (Earnest)
#### True

&nbsp;

>>> print("Duvel" + "Bear")
#### DuvelBear

>>> print ("Duvel " + "Bear")
#### Duvel Bear

&nbsp;

>>> ExtraKitty = 100
>>> print (ExtraKitty > 6)
#### True

&nbsp;

>>> print ("Duvel " * 3)
#### Duvel Duvel Duvel
