#### NYC Bike/Roller/Skate Chronic Complaints
This dashboard shows all complaints categorized as "Bike/Roller/Skate Chronic" with associated official response to each. Pretty sure this is mostly skateboarding complaints, with maybe some BMX mixed in. Rollerbladers aren't much of a scourge nowadays.

This is my first multi-chart dashboard that looks ok on desktop. Hooray! It's a total unusable mess on mobile, but I'm sure I'll learn how to fix that soon.
