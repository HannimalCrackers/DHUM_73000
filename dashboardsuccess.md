#### NYC Bike/Roller/Skate Chronic Complaints
This dashboard shows visualizations of the complaint category titled "Bike/Roller/Skate Chronic." Pretty sure this is mostly skateboarding complaints, with maybe some BMX mixed in. Rollerbladers aren't much of a scourge nowadays.

This is my first multi-chart dashboard that looks ok on desktop. I'm sure it's a mess on mobile, but I'll get there.
