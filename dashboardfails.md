# Dashboard Fail

#### NYC Parks Violations 311 Complaints Overview
I made this dashboard with floating containers. It looks great in Tableau Public, both on desktop and web, but embedded into a blog it looks terrible and everything crashes together unless viewed in full screen mode. You can sort of wiggle the pie chart around in the frame, which is fun, but not desired functionality.

Possible sources of dismay: floating containers? GitHub size constraints?
