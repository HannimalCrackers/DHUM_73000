I made one dashboard with floating containers that looks great in Tableau Public, both on desktop and web, but embedded into this blog it looks terrible and everything is crashing together unless viewed in full screen mode. 

My current theories for what may be causing the issues are that this is maybe the result of using floating containers for the dashboard segments, or perhaps GitHub blog pages are not able to display elements this wide.
