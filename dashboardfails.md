# Dashboard Fails

#### NYC Parks Violations 311 Complaints Overview
I made this dashboard with floating containers. It looks great in Tableau Public, both on desktop and web, but embedded into a blog it looks terrible and everything crashes together unless viewed in full screen mode. 

Possible sources of dismay: floating containers, GitHub size constraints?
