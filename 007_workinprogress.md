# Things I'm learning working on this final project

#### Introduction

* How to make a bulleted list in markdown with an asterisk then a space
    * How to make nested lists in markdown
    * That bulleted lists work with either an asterisk or a hyphen

* That my GitHub directory was already getting messy
    * Renamed all blogposts with 00#_ prefix to order and sort to top
    
* How to custom split columns in the Data Source pane in Tableau
    * Photo taken info came in as a mashed together string field / separated into identifiable date and time
    * Realized late that just changing field format worked fine, but now I know how to split if I ever need to
