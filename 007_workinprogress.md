# Things I'm learning working on this final project

#### Listing

* How to make a bulleted list in markdown with an asterisk then a space
    * How to make nested lists in markdown
    * That bulleted lists work with either an asterisk or a hyphen

&nbsp;
* That my GitHub directory was already getting messy
    * Renamed all blogposts with ###_ prefix to order and sort to top
    
&nbsp;
* How to custom split columns in the Data Source pane in Tableau
    * Photo taken info came in as a mashed together string field / separated into identifiable date and time
    * Realized late that just changing field format worked fine, but now I know how to split if I ever need to

&nbsp;
* Current challenge: how to split caption string to get hashtags isolated
    * Ok, got all hashtags split off and the hash character readded but it probably took too many CALCs and it's adding hashtag characters to the empty fields as well. Not best use of time to keep going at this. Tabling and moving on.
    
&nbsp;
* I used commands I didn't understand in Terminal to batch rename my images, even though it was scary.
