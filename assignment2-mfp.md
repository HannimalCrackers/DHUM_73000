# Looking for Factors in Overall Calorie Consumption

#### Introduction

I started with a simple question: does increasing sugar intake one day lead to higher calorie consumption the next day? I had a hunch it did, and – having tracked my eating habits with MyFitnessPal for some time – I had the data to explore my hypothesis.

Upfront, I’ll say I was wrong. My data showed no positive correlation between increased sugar intake and subsequent increased caloric intake. If anything, I tend to eat less the next day. I expanded my question to look at whether protein or fat might have the effect I was looking for. Higher proportional protein intake shows some correlation with steadier low caloric intake, but further investigation is needed.

This research was done primarily for myself, as I was curious about my own cravings, but those looking to see what kind of exploration may be done with downloaded personal MFP data (or looking for some very tenuous evidence that indulging now and then will not instantly doom their diet) may also be interested in reading on. I explored this question with my downloaded personal data from MFP, utilizing fields that captured date along with calories consumed, sugar consumed – which was provided in grams, and protein and fat consumed – both also provided in grams.
