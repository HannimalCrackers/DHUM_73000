#### Research question

How does the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks Dept) respond to citizen complaints about violations of parks rules, and how are enforcement resources allocated? Insights can be gleaned from how the city responds to requests submitted to 311.

#### Audience

Interested audiences for this analysis are (1) Parks Dept management, who might like to see how their employees are choosing to enact enforcement, and (2) the citizens of NYC, who are interested parties in how their taxes are being spent and their public lives are being regulated while in parks.

#### Visualizations intro

To explore this research question, I used a dataset made publicly available by the NYC government which contains all 311 Service Requests made in the year 2015. The dataset filename as downloaded is 311_Service_Requests_from_2015.csv. All visualizations in this post are built from this dataset using Tableau Public. 

Explanations of the data and design decisions made are included in the discussions with each visualization, rather than in a separate section.

#### Visualization A: Number of Complaints Table

This table shows complaints received by 311 about various types of behavior in parks. Complaint types are listed at left, with the total number of complaints received about each in 2015 showninthecolumnatright. The numbers column is color coded as a heat map along a light-to-dark spectrum, with theleast common complaint category (Other Complaints) in the lightest color and the most common complaint category (Obstructing Public Use) in the darkest color.

The “Other Complaints” categoryconsolidatesrelatively few complaints about removing plants or flowers, unauthorized climbing, unauthorized posting of signs, and prohibited use of newly seeded lawns.
